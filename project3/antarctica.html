                    design and has been used by various National Antarctic Programs, Antarctic nonprofits, and expedition teams.

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not confirmed until the early 1820s
                when British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions
                began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle.
                Not until <time datetime="1840">1840</time> was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent
                and not merely a group of islands or an area of ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the early 20th century, but generally, the area saw little human activity.
            </p>

            <h3>Scientific Research</h3>
            <p>
                Following World War II, however, the continent experienced an upsurge in scientific research. A number of countries
                have set up a range of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica.
                Seven have made territorial claims and two maintain the basis for a claim, but most countries do not recognize these claims.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated
                that neither denies nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in <time datetime="1959">1959</time>, it
                entered into force in <time datetime="1961">1961</time>. Also relevant to Antarctic governance are the Environmental
                Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.

            <h3>Location</h3>
            <p>Antarctica is a continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>
                Antarctica is the coldest, windiest, and driest continent on Earth. Severe low temperatures vary with
                latitude, elevation, and distance from the ocean.
                East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher elevation. The Antarctic Peninsula
                has the most moderate climate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Higher temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below freezing. Summers are
                characterized by continuous daylight, while winters bring continuous darkness.
                Persistent high pressure over the interior brings dry, subsiding air that results in very little cloud cover.

                        Including parts of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,
                        and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound.

            <h3>Government Type</h3>
            <p>
                The governance of Antarctica is primarily managed through the Antarctic Treaty system, which includes:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Antarctic Treaty, signed on <time datetime="1959-12-01">1 December 1959</time> and entered into
                    force on <time datetime="1961-06-23">23 June 1961</time>. It establishes the legal framework for the
                    management of Antarctica.</li>
                <li>Measures, Decisions, and Resolutions adopted at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings.</li>
                <li>The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (<time datetime="1972">1972</time>).</li>
                <li>The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (<time datetime="1980">1980</time>).</li>
                <li>The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (<time datetime="1991">1991</time>).</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings operate by consensus (not by vote) of all consultative parties
                at annual Treaty meetings. As of <time datetime="2022-01">January 2022</time>, there were 54 treaty member
                nations: 29 consultative and 25 non-consultative.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consultative (decision-making) members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as
                national territory (some claims overlap) and 22 non-claimant nations. The US and Russia have reserved
                the right to make claims, but the US does not recognize the claims of others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Antarctica is administered through meetings of the consultative member nations, and measures adopted at
                these meetings are carried out by these member nations (with respect to their own nationals and operations)
                in accordance with their own national laws.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Legal System</h3>
            <p>
                The legal system governing Antarctica covers all areas between 60 and 90 degrees south latitude and is
                subject to various legal instruments and procedures adopted by the states party to the Antarctic Treaty.
                US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such as murder, may apply extraterritorially.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica, for example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16
                <abbr title="United States Code">U.S.C.</abbr> section 2401 <abbr title="et sequens">et seq.</abbr>,
                provides civil and criminal penalties for specific activities unless authorized by regulation or statute.
