        <h2>Introduction</h2>



            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was not confirmed until the early 1820s
                when British and American commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions
                began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south of the Antarctic Circle.
                Not until <time datetime="1840">1840</time> was it established that Antarctica was indeed a continent
                and not merely a group of islands or an area of ocean. Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in
                the early 20th century, but generally the area saw little human activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following World War II, however, the continent
                experienced an upsurge in scientific research. A number of countries have set up a range of
                year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges to support scientific research in Antarctica.
                Seven have made territorial claims and two maintain the basis for a claim, but most countries do
                not recognize these claims.
            </p>
            <p>In order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on
                the continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies nor gives recognition to
                existing territorial claims; signed in <time datetime="1959">1959</time>, it entered into force in
                <time datetime="1961">1961</time>.  Also relevant to Antarctic governance are the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty
                and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.

            <h3><strong>Location</strong></h3>
            <p>continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle</p>
            <h3><strong>Climate</strong></h3>
            <p>
                the coldest, windiest, and driest continent on Earth; severe low temperatures vary with latitude,
                elevation, and distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its
                higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate;
            </p>
            <p>
                higher temperatures occur in
                January along the coast and average slightly below freezing; summers characterized by continuous
                daylight, while winters bring continuous darkness; persistent high pressure over the interior brings
                dry, subsiding air that results in very little cloud cover
            </p>
            <h3><strong>Terrain</strong></h3>
            <p>
                about 99% thick continental ice sheet and 1% barren rock, with average elevations between 2,000 and
                4,000 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> mountain ranges up to nearly 5,000 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr>;
                ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern
                Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound;
                glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute 11%
                of the area of the continent

                Antarctic Treaty Summary - the Antarctic region is governed by a system known as the Antarctic
                Treaty system; the system includes: 1. the Antarctic Treaty, signed on
                <time datetime="1959-12-01">1 December 1959</time> and entered into force on
                <time datetime="1961-06-23">23 June 1961</time>, which establishes the legal framework for the management
                of Antarctica, 2. Measures, Decisions, and Resolutions adopted at Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings,
                3. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (<time datetime="1972">1972</time>), 4. The
                Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (<time datetime="1980">1980</time>),
                and 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
                Antarctic Treaty (<time datetime="1991">1991</time>); the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings
                operate by consensus (not by vote) of all consultative parties at annual Treaty meetings; by
                <time datetime="2022-01">January 2022</time>, there were 54 treaty member nations: 29 consultative and
                25 non-consultative; consultative (decision-making) members include the seven nations that claim
                portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and 22 non-claimant nations;
            </p>
            <p>
                the US and Russia have reserved the right to make claims; the US does not
                recognize the claims of others; Antarctica is administered through meetings of the consultative member
                nations; measures adopted at these meetings are carried out by these member nations (with respect to
                their own nationals and operations) in accordance with their own national laws;
            </p>
            <h3>Legal System</h3>
            <p>
                Antarctica is administered through annual meetings - known as Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings -
                which include consultative member nations, non-consultative member nations, observer organizations,
                and expert organizations; decisions from these meetings are carried out by these member nations
                (with respect to their own nationals and operations) in accordance with their own national laws;
            </p>
            <p>
                more
                generally, the Antarctic Treaty area, that is to all areas between 60 and 90 degrees south latitude,
                is subject to a number of relevant legal instruments and procedures adopted by the states party to the
                Antarctic Treaty; note - US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such
                as murder, may apply extraterritoriality; some US laws directly apply to Antarctica;
            </p>
            <p>
                for example, the
                Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 <abbr title="United States Code">U.S.C.</abbr> section 2401
                <abbr title="et sequens">et seq.</abbr>, provides civil and criminal penalties for
                the following activities unless authorized by regulation or statute: the taking of native mammals or
                birds; the introduction of nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially protected areas; the
                discharge or disposal of pollutants;
